In this exercise, 100 numbers are, from 1 to 100 (both inclusive), but:
    - instead of printing multiples of 3, "Fizz" will be printed out;
    - instead of printing multiples of 5, "Buzz" will be printed out;
    - instead of printing multiples of both 3 and 5, "FizzBuzz" will be printed out.
The program will print a combination of numbers, Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz.
